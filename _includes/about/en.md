I am __Yixuan Zheng__, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Ken Caldeira's lab](https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/labs/caldeiralab/), at the [Department of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution for Science, ](https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/).

My current study tries to reveal the potential climate benefits of poverty eradication.

Before coming to the Carnegie Institution, I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. During my Ph.D., I studied drivers of China's fine particulate (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) air pollution and its attributable premature mortality.
